When given a csv (or Excel file) of addresses and any additional information (as can be seen in the file 'nput_example.xlsx'), this script fetches the longtitude and langtitude of each address, and writes a new file containing the old + new information and adds suitable headers to the table.

This script was used as a part of a mapping project for a mapping contest at The Hebrew University of
Jerusalem.

Usage: extract_coords.py <path to excel\csv file>
